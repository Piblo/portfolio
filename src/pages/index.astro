        I am a front-end developer specialised on the react ecosystem and the
        .NET stack. My latest projects involved leading development teams in
        order to create highly bespoke user interfaces, following designs
        produced by UX designers. As a lead developer, I was also part of
        discovery sessions with the stakeholders, acted as a scrum master,
        making sure that the development methodology was followed along the
        lifecycle of the project, established good relationships across
        different teams and business areas, and ran sessions to mentor peers
